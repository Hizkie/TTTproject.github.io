Guys i complete the navbar, now is completely responsive and it works even on mobile. I test it on firefox. Maybe we gotta try
it on another browser. Is it possible to change colors if you prefere some.

I think it might also be possible write some css to decorate the window that appears on clicking the change document 
and change style buttons.

TODO:

1) link all the pages
2) test the files

OPTIONAL

1) MOVE THE NAVBAR ON A SPECIFIC FILE AND LOAD IT DINAMICALLY WITH JS

since now i think there is just js todo.


For Davide: how is it going with @media queries? 

I found really useful use the developer console in the browser i post you a screenshot.
It make you modify the window and tells you the size (width) of the page.
